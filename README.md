I've recently developed a comprehensive bus service application using Django and Python, with SQLite serving as the database backend. This application is designed to help passengers find the shortest route between any two locations, optimizing travel time and convenience. Beyond route planning, the service also features real-time bus timings, ensuring users can plan their journeys with up-to-date information. By integrating mapping functionalities and leveraging Django's robust framework, the application offers a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and bus schedule management. It represents a significant enhancement in public transportation accessibility, providing reliable travel information to passengers on-demand.
